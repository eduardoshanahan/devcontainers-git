## Why do I have this project?

In the last few years I have been using Visual Studio Code, and I like to use as much containers as I can, instead of setting up environments for Python or things like that.

Devcontainers is pretty handy for that, and it is just a short step to move it into a deployment when I am done.

I found myself recreating a similar setup each time, with more or less features each time, and this is an attempt to simplify that step.

I am thinking of creating a few different devcontainers, each based on a previous iteration (although I don't like inheritance, in this case seems to be valuable).

This is the first run. Just Ubuntu (my remote deployments are usually containers based in Ubuntu) with git and some editing tools (Markdown validation, some git shortcuts, and that is it).

VS Code is also configured to use the validation tools by way of extensions, and they also hang as command line tools (although I don't use them regularly).

An extra situation is that I have also a Synology NAS where I synchronise my files. I commit to git when ready, but I like to be able to continue working in any of my machines and have them in sync automatically. Synology Drive is good for that.

However, there are some tricky cases around file ownership (I use Ubuntu 24.10 at the moment in my own machines). Depending on where the files are created (the workstation or inside the container), Synology gets confused and start to cause troubles around the synchronisation process.

A way around it is to use the same user inside the container as it is outside. A launch script takes care of that details passing activity, and all the files seems to be updated correctly now.

I want to be able to use Git inside and out of the container, then I also pass the ssh credentials to my Git remote repository to syncronise at will. That also seems to be working correctly.

## Overview
This project serves as a comprehensive template for setting up **Development Containers (Devcontainers)**. It is designed to provide a consistent, reproducible, and containerized development environment, primarily for use with Visual Studio Code, Cursor, or Antigravity.

## Core Problem Solved
The project addresses the challenge of maintaining consistent development environments across multiple machines. It specifically targets issues related to:
- **File Synchronization**: mitigating conflicts when using services like Synology Drive for syncing code between machines.
- **File Ownership**: handling UID/GID mapping to prevent permission issues between the host/container and the synchronization service.
- **Reproducibility**: eliminating "it works on my machine" problems by defining the environment in code.

## Key Features

### 1. Containerized Environment
- Provides a pre-configured `Dockerfile` based on Ubuntu.
- Includes essential development tools:
    - **Git** (with SSH support)
    - **Docker CLI** (for Docker-in-Docker capabilities)
    - **Starship** (for a modern shell prompt)
    - **JSON tools** (`jq`, linters)

### 2. Intelligent Launch System
- Includes a `launch.sh` script that:
    - Validates environment variables (`.env`).
    - Checks for required tools.
    - Launches the user's preferred editor (VS Code, Cursor, or Antigravity).
    - Ensures the local environment is correctly prepped before starting the container.

### 3. Git & SSH Integration
- Seamlessly forwards SSH agents to the container, allowing secure GitHub interactions without storing keys inside the image. When `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is forwarded from the host we reuse it; only if it is missing do we start a fresh agent and manage keys locally.
- Automates Git configuration (user name, email) based on environment variables.

### 4. Custom Synchronization
- Features a `sync_git.sh` script to safely manage Git operations in environments where an external file syncer (like Synology Drive) is also active, preventing data corruption or conflicts.

## Quick Start

1. **Copy the env template:** `cp .env.example .env`
2. **Fill in required values:** edit `.env` so `HOST_USERNAME`, UID/GID, git identity, remotes, and editor choice match your machine (see the comments inside the file).
3. **Launch your editor via the helper:** run `./launch.sh`. It loads `.env`, validates it, and then opens VS Code/Cursor/Antigravity pointing at this folder.
4. **Reopen in container:** inside the editor, use the Dev Containers extension’s “Reopen in Container” command; it reuses the values validated in step 3.
5. **Work normally:** run `./scripts/sync_git.sh` whenever you need to pull/push (configure `GIT_SYNC_REMOTES`/`GIT_SYNC_PUSH_REMOTES` if you use multiple remotes). SSH agent forwarding just works as long as your host exposes `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.

## Usage
Users clone this repository, configure a `.env` file with their specific user details (UID/GID, Git credentials), and use the provided scripts to launch their editor. The editor then reopens the project inside the defined Docker container, providing a fully featured development workspace.

### Keeping the repository in sync

Run `./scripts/sync_git.sh` whenever you want to fast-forward the local checkout or publish your current branch. Configure the remotes the script should touch via `.env`:

```env
# Pull from both GitHub and LAN mirrors (GitHub is the primary remote here)
GIT_SYNC_REMOTES="origin lan"

# Optionally push the current branch to both mirrors after syncing
GIT_SYNC_PUSH_REMOTES="origin lan"

# Provide a URL if the script needs to auto-add the LAN remote
GIT_REMOTE_URL_LAN="ssh://git@192.168.1.10:/volume1/git/devcontainers-git.git"
```

Once configured, you can run:

```bash
# standard update (requires a clean working tree)
./scripts/sync_git.sh

# overwrite local changes with the remote version
FORCE_PULL=true ./scripts/sync_git.sh
```

- The script only touches the current repository (no global git config, no backups).  
- It ensures every remote listed in `GIT_SYNC_REMOTES` exists (using `GIT_REMOTE_URL` or `GIT_REMOTE_URL_<REMOTE>` values if it needs to add one).  
- The first remote in `GIT_SYNC_REMOTES` is treated as the primary upstream for pulls/resets; additional remotes are rebased in sequence so they stay in sync.  
- Set `GIT_SYNC_PUSH_REMOTES` to automatically push the branch after syncing (leave empty to skip pushes).  
- If you have uncommitted changes it exits with an error unless you re-run it with `FORCE_PULL=true`.
