# State - 2026-01-09

- Launch scripts (`editor-launch.sh`, `devcontainer-launch.sh`, `claude-launch.sh`) are now in sync with their counterparts under `references/` (cosmetic deltas only).
- `.devcontainer/scripts/env-loader.sh` has improved debug output and safer temp-file handling; it still preserves a valid `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.
- `.devcontainer/config/starship.toml` now shows `CONTAINER_HOSTNAME` when present (via `env_var.CONTAINER_HOSTNAME`).
- ADR coverage updated for recent decisions: `documentation/adr/ADR-0006-tag-devcontainer-images-via-launch-scripts.md` and `documentation/adr/ADR-0007-isolate-devcontainer-sessions-with-id-label.md`.
