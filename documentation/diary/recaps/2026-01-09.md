# Recap - 2026-01-09

- Compared `references/editor-launch.sh` and synced minor messaging/wording into `editor-launch.sh`.
- Compared `references/devcontainer-launch.sh` and synced minor formatting/wording into `devcontainer-launch.sh`.
- Compared `references/claude-launch.sh` and synced minor formatting/wording into `claude-launch.sh`.
- Incorporated the reference env-loader improvements into `.devcontainer/scripts/env-loader.sh` (debug now lists new var names; optional value printing).
- Pulled `env_var.CONTAINER_HOSTNAME` into `.devcontainer/config/starship.toml` so the prompt can show the container hostname.
- Moved the daily journal into `documentation/diary/` (renaming the former `lm` folder) and updated docs to match.
- Added ADRs for image tagging via launch scripts and session isolation via `--id-label` (`documentation/adr/ADR-0006-tag-devcontainer-images-via-launch-scripts.md`, `documentation/adr/ADR-0007-isolate-devcontainer-sessions-with-id-label.md`).
- Added a documentation index at `documentation/README.md` and linked it from the root `README.md`.
