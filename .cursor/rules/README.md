# Cursor Rules

This directory contains all Cursor rules for the project. Each rule is defined in its own markdown file and follows a consistent structure.

## Rule Files

- [organization.md](organization.md) - Rules for organizing Cursor rules
- Add new rules here...

## Creating New Rules

1. Create a new markdown file in this directory
2. Use kebab-case for the file name (e.g., `my-new-rule.md`)
3. Follow the structure defined in [organization.md](organization.md)
4. Add the rule to this README

## Structure

Each rule file should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Rule: [Rule Name]

## Description
[Brief description of the rule]

## Structure
[If applicable, describe the structure this rule enforces]

## Examples
[Provide clear examples of good and bad practices]

## Enforcement
[Describe how the rule should be enforced]
```
