# Multi-Session Development Rules

## Core Principle: Session Continuity and Knowledge Preservation

When working on projects across multiple sessions, **NEVER lose context or progress** - always maintain detailed notes, session summaries, and clear continuity markers to enable seamless resumption of work.

## Session Management Rules

### **ALWAYS Create Session Documentation**

**❌ WRONG - Don't do this**:

```text
"Let's continue where we left off"
"Remember what we were working on?"
"Let me check what we did last time"
```

**✅ CORRECT - Do this instead**:

```text
"Session 3: Continuing Ansible role development from session 2"
"Resuming from: Implementation Phase 1.2 - Base Role Creation"
"Previous session completed: Docker Compose configuration"
```

### **Session Documentation Requirements**

#### **1. Session Summary File**

```markdown
# Session 3 - Ansible Base Role Implementation
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Duration**: 2 hours
**Previous Session**: Session 2 - Project Structure Setup

## What Was Accomplished

- Created basic Ansible project structure
- Implemented base role for VPS configuration
- Set up inventory management

## Current Status

- **Phase**: 1.2 Implement Base Role
- **Progress**: 75% complete
- **Next Steps**: Complete role testing and validation

## Key Decisions Made

- Using Ubuntu 22.04 as base OS
- Implementing UFW firewall configuration
- Setting up Docker network isolation

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/roles/base/tasks/main.yml`
- `src/roles/base/defaults/main.yml`
- `inventory/hosts.yml`

## Issues Encountered

- Docker network configuration complexity
- UFW rule ordering dependencies

## Next Session Goals

- Complete base role implementation
- Begin Phase 1.3 - Inventory Management
```

#### **2. Progress Tracking**

```markdown
## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Ansible Infrastructure Setup

- [x] 1.1 Create Basic Ansible Structure (Session 2)
- [ ] 1.2 Implement Base Role (Session 3 - IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] 1.3 Create Inventory Management

### Phase 2: Traefik Deployment

- [ ] 2.1 Docker Compose Configuration
- [ ] 2.2 Traefik Configuration Templates
- [ ] 2.3 Ansible Role for Traefik
```

## Knowledge Preservation Rules

### **1. Context Preservation**

- **ALWAYS** document the current state before ending a session
- **ALWAYS** note what was working and what wasn't
- **ALWAYS** capture any errors or issues encountered
- **ALWAYS** document key decisions and their rationale

### **2. File State Documentation**

- **ALWAYS** note which files were created or modified
- **ALWAYS** document any configuration changes
- **ALWAYS** capture any test results or validation outcomes
- **ALWAYS** note any dependencies or requirements discovered

### **3. Decision Documentation**

```markdown
## Key Decisions Made This Session

### Decision 1: Network Architecture
**Context**: Need to determine how applications will communicate
**Decision**: Use hybrid network isolation approach
**Rationale**: Provides security benefits with minimal complexity
**Impact**: Applications need to be on multiple networks

### Decision 2: Configuration Management
**Context**: Need to manage sensitive configuration data
**Decision**: Use hybrid approach (config files + env vars)
**Rationale**: Best balance of security and maintainability
**Impact**: Requires both file and environment management
```

## Continuity Rules

### **1. Session Handoff**

- **ALWAYS** update the current session file
- **ALWAYS** create a session summary
- **ALWAYS** update progress tracking
- **ALWAYS** document next session goals

### **2. Session Resumption**

- **ALWAYS** read the previous session summary
- **ALWAYS** check the current state documentation
- **ALWAYS** review any pending issues
- **ALWAYS** verify the current phase and progress

### **3. State Verification**

```markdown
## Session Resumption Checklist

- [ ] Read previous session summary
- [ ] Check current state documentation
- [ ] Review pending issues and decisions
- [ ] Verify current phase and progress
- [ ] Check file modifications from last session
- [ ] Review any configuration changes
- [ ] Confirm next session goals
```

## Documentation Standards

### **1. File Naming Convention**

```text
sessions/
├── current-session.md          # Active session documentation
├── session-001-summary.md      # Session 1 summary
├── session-002-summary.md      # Session 2 summary
└── session-XXX-summary.md      # Session X summary
```

<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>

```text
progress/
├── implementation-progress.md  # Overall progress tracking
├── decision-log.md            # All decisions made
└── issues-log.md              # Issues and resolutions
```

### **3. Continuity Management**

```text
continuity/
├── current-state.md           # Current project state
├── session-continuity.md      # Session-to-session continuity
└── knowledge-base.md          # Accumulated knowledge
```

## Quality Assurance

### **1. Session Review**

- **ALWAYS** review session documentation before ending
- **ALWAYS** verify all changes are documented
- **ALWAYS** ensure next session goals are clear
- **ALWAYS** validate that context is preserved

### **2. Documentation Validation**

- **ALWAYS** check that all files created/modified are listed
- **ALWAYS** verify that all decisions are documented
- **ALWAYS** ensure that issues are properly described
- **ALWAYS** confirm that next steps are actionable

## Summary

**NEVER lose context** - always maintain comprehensive session documentation to ensure seamless project continuity across multiple development sessions.
