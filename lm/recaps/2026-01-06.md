# Recap - 2026-01-06

- Prepared lm state/plan/recap files for today; ready to tackle review findings.
- Fixed review items: devcontainer.json settings, README Docker CLI claim, script docs, no implicit defaults, SSH_AUTH_SOCK validation, markdown emoji removal, Claude installer checksum option.
- Converted all shell scripts to POSIX sh and removed bashisms; updated shebangs and syntax.
- Added `how to use this project.md` and `how to test.md`, then reorganized `README.md` to follow the example structure.
- Added `troubleshooting.md` and linked it from `README.md`.
- Added `how to use sync_git.md` and linked it from `README.md`.
- Added `file sync and ownership.md` and linked it from `README.md`.
- Added `how to use devcontainer cli.md` and `how to use claude.md`, then linked them from `README.md`.
- Moved documentation markdown files into `documentation/` and updated README links; kept `README.md` and `agents.md` at root.
- Rewrote git history to remove `.devcontainer/.postStartCommandMarker` and force-pushed to origin.
