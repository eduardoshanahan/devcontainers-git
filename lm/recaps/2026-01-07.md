# Recap - 2026-01-07

- Removed `initializeCommand` and `postStopCommand` from `devcontainer.json` and moved `CONTAINER_*` values into `containerEnv`.
- Added an entrypoint script that traps shutdown signals and emits the post-stop message.
- Inlined the post-stop message into the entrypoint and deleted `post-stop.sh`.
- Fixed the Dockerfile copy path for the entrypoint to match the build context.
