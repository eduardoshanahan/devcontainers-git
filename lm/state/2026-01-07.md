# State - 2026-01-07

- Devcontainer now runs stop logic via an entrypoint trap; `post-stop.sh` removed.
- `devcontainer.json` cleanup: removed `initializeCommand` and `postStopCommand`, moved `CONTAINER_*` to `containerEnv`.
- Dockerfile now installs the entrypoint and sets `ENTRYPOINT`.
- Pending: rebuild the devcontainer to confirm the entrypoint copy succeeds and the stop hook runs on shutdown.
